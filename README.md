# Number-Base-Converter
This Python script allows you to convert numbers between different bases, including bases with decimal points. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering the number, the base to convert from, and the base to convert to. The script also includes checks for input validity and ensures the bases are "friends" for certain conversions.
